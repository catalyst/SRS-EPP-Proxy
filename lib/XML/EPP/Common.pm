# see EPP.pm, nearby, for introdutory explanatory notes

# this is a custom mapping.  Probably many of them will be for this
# class, as our normal definition of what to call the classes - based
# on the element name in which they are used - falls down completely;
# this spec for the most part defines types for use by the other
# standards.

# "AuthInfo" is usually introduced with a <pw> tag, so we'll call it
# Password
use XML::EPP::Common::Password;

# <ext>, but it's basically still a password.
