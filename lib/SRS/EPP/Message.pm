=head1 NAME

SRS::EPP::Message - abstract type for a single message particle

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $msg = SRS::EPP::Message->new(
     message => $object,
     xml => $xml,
     error => $message,
     );
 # convert a message to XML
 $message->to_xml;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a common ancestor of EPP commands and responses, as well
as SRS requests and responses.  Currently the only method that all of
these implement is conversion to XML; however parsing is likely to
follow.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<SRS::EPP::Command>, L<SRS::EPP::Response>

=for thought

What space should we stick SRS messages under?  I reckon maybe plain
SRS::Request:: and SRS::Response::, and subclass them...
