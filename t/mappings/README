These files are run by both t/mappings.t and t/integration.t. The former is a unit test, and applies all assertions,
the latter is a full integration test, requires a properly configured EPP proxy talking to a properly configurd SRS,
and only applies the output assertions.

For the integration tests, certain data is assumed to be setup already. Also, the SRS is assumed to be handling the .te cctld.
The data to be setup (if any) is in a sub directory called 'create', in a format handled by RegistrarTests (not part of this
distribution!). There is also an optional 'cleanup' dir, which contains any SRS requests that should be fired after the test
is run.
